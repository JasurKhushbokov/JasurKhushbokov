ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jasur!
I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in web development and software engineering. Currently, I'm focused on building projects using ASP.NET Core MVC, while continuously learning new tools and technologies. I enjoy solving complex challenges and have experience working with various methodologies, including Gitflow, SCRUM (Agile), and TDD with xUnit.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
